# Moon-Data-Classification
Define and train a custom, PyTorch neural network to create a binary classifier for data that is separated into two classes; the data looks like two moon shapes when it is displayed, and is often referred to as moon data.    
\
The notebook will be broken down into a few steps:
\
1) Generating the moon data  
2) Loading it into an S3 bucket  
3) Defining a PyTorch binary classifier  
4) Completing a training script  
5) Training and deploying the custom model  
6) Evaluating its performance
