# Moon-Data-Classification
Define and train a custom, PyTorch neural network to create a binary classifier for data that is separated into two classes; the data looks like two moon shapes when it is displayed, and is often referred to as moon data.    
\
1)The notebook will be broken down into a few steps:    
2)Generating the moon data  
3)Loading it into an S3 bucket  
4)Defining a PyTorch binary classifier  
5)Completing a training script  
6)Training and deploying the custom model  
7)Evaluating its performance
