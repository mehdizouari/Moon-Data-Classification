# Moon-Data-Classification
Define and train a custom, PyTorch neural network to create a binary classifier for data that is separated into two classes; the data looks like two moon shapes when it is displayed, and is often referred to as moon data.  
The notebook will be broken down into a few steps:    
Generating the moon data  
Loading it into an S3 bucket  
Defining a PyTorch binary classifier  
Completing a training script  
Training and deploying the custom model  
Evaluating its performance
